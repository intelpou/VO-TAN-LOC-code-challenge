## Computational Inefficiencies and Anti-Patterns
1> Incorrect Dependency in useMemo:
The dependency array of useMemo includes prices, but prices is not used within the memoized function. This can cause unnecessary recalculations when prices changes.
-> Improvement: Remove prices from the dependency array if it's not used.

2> Undefined Variable lhsPriority:
In the filter method, lhsPriority is used but not defined anywhere. This will cause a runtime error.
-> Improvement: Define lhsPriority or correct the logic to use the appropriate variable.

3> balancePriority Is Nerver Used:
balancePriority was created for lhsPriority.
-> Improvement: refactor this variable.

4> Incorrect Sorting Logic:
The sorting logic only considers the priority of the blockchain but does not handle equal priorities correctly. It should also consider other factors like the balance amount.
-> Improvement: Enhance the sorting logic to handle equal priorities by comparing balance amounts or other relevant factors.

5> Unnecessary Mapping Operations:

The code maps over sortedBalances twice: once to format balances and once to create rows. This can be optimized by doing both operations in a single map.
-> Improvement: Combine the mapping operations to reduce unnecessary iterations.

6> Using Index as Key:
Using the index as a key for components can lead to issues if the list changes (e.g., items are added or removed). It's better to use a unique identifier.
-> Improvement: Use a unique identifier from the balance data as the key.

7> Potential Performance Issue with Large Data:
If balances is very large, filtering and sorting could be expensive operations. Consider optimizing these operations or using more efficient data structures.
-> Improvement: Use efficient algorithms or data structures for large datasets.

8> Type any for blockchain Parameter:
Using any for the blockchain parameter in getPriority can lead to structure type. It's better to define a specific type for blockchain names.
-> Improvement: Define an enum or a union type for blockchain names.



## Here's a refactored version

interface WalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
  blockchain: string; // Define blockchain type
}

interface FormattedWalletBalance {
  currency: string;
  amount: number;
  formatted: string;
}

interface Props extends BoxProps {}

const blockchains: { [key: string]: number } = {
  Osmosis: 100,
  Ethereum: 50,
  Arbitrum: 30,
  Zilliqa: 20,
  Neo: 20,
};

const WalletPage: React.FC<Props> = (props: Props) => {
  const { children, ...rest } = props;
  const balances = useWalletBalances();
  const prices = usePrices();

  const getPriority = (blockchain: string): number => blockchains[blockchain] ?? -99;

  const sortedBalances = useMemo(() => {
    return balances
      .filter((balance: WalletBalance) => balance.amount <= 0 && getPriority(balance.blockchain) > -99)
      .sort((lhs: WalletBalance, rhs: WalletBalance) => getPriority(lhs.blockchain) - getPriority(rhs.blockchain));
  }, [balances]);

  const rows = sortedBalances.map((balance, index) => {
    const usdValue = prices[balance.currency] * balance.amount;
    const formattedBalance = { ...balance, formatted: balance.amount.toFixed() };
    return (
      <WalletRow
        className={classes.row}
        key={balance.currency} // Use a unique key
        amount={balance.amount}
        usdValue={usdValue}
        formattedAmount={formattedBalance.formatted}
      />
    );
  });

  return (
    <div {...rest}>
      {rows}
    </div>
  );
};
