## Software Module Specification for API Service

# Overview
This software module is designed to manage user scores and provide live updates to a scoreboard on a website. It will handle API calls from clients to update scores securely and prevent unauthorized score increments.


# API Endpoints
> The API will have the following endpoints:

  POST /update-score: Updates a user's score.
    Request Body: { "userId": string, "scoreIncrement": integer }
    Response: { "success": boolean, "message": string }

  GET /scoreboard: Retrieves the top 10 user scores.
    Response: [ { "userId": string, "score": integer } ]


# Security Measures
> Authentication: All API calls must include a valid authentication token to verify the user's identity.
> Authorization: Only authorized users can update their own scores.


# Implementation Details
> Database: Use a relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to store user scores.
> WebSockets or Webhooks: Implement WebSockets or Webhooks for live updates to the scoreboard.

    Note over Client,Server: User completes an action
    Client->>Server: POST /update-score (with auth token)
    Server->>Server: Validate authentication and authorization
    alt Valid request
        Server->>Database: Update user score
        Database->>Server: Confirm update
        Server->>Client: Return success response
        Server->>Server: Trigger live update via WebSockets/Webhooks
    else Invalid request
        Server->>Client: Return error response
    end


# Additional Comments for Improvement
> Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent malicious users from flooding the API with requests.
> Asynchronous Processing: Use a message queue to handle score updates asynchronously, improving performance under heavy loads.
> WebSockets vs. Webhooks: Choose between WebSockets for real-time updates or Webhooks for event-driven notifications based on the application's requirements.
> Monitoring and Logging: Set up monitoring tools to track API performance and log errors for easier debugging.
